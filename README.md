# Breast Cancer Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
---
---
## üìã Project Overview:
#### The Breast Cancer Prediction app is designed to assist in identifying whether a breast tumor is Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous). It uses a machine learning model trained on historical data of tumor features to classify the tumor. This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input tumor details and get predictions instantly.

## üìå K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and effective supervised machine learning technique.
- **How it Works:**
  - KNN classifies a new data point based on its proximity to other data points in the dataset.
  - It calculates the distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the new data point and its nearest neighbors.
  - The majority class among the neighbors determines the classification result.

## üîç Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains real-world data on breast tumors.
  - **Features:** The dataset includes numeric features that describe various characteristics of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies.
  - **Labels:**
           -  **Benign (0):** Tumors that are non-cancerous and do not spread to other parts of the body.
           -  **Malignant (1):** Cancerous tumors that can invade nearby tissues or spread.

## üîë Key Features:
   - **Clump Thickness:** Uniformity of the cell clumps.
   - **Uniformity of Cell Size:** Variation in cell size.
   - **Uniformity of Cell Shape:** Consistency in cell shape.
   - **Marginal Adhesion:** How well cells stick together.
   - **Single Epithelial Cell Size:** Size of single epithelial cells.
   - **Bare Nuclei:** Count of nuclei without cytoplasm.
   - **Bland Chromatin:** Consistency of chromatin in the nucleus.
   - **Normal Nucleoli:** Size and visibility of nucleoli.
   - **Mitoses:** Frequency of cell division.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in features like Bare Nuclei to ensure a consistent dataset.
  - **Normalization:** Scaling the features to ensure they are on the same range, which helps the machine learning algorithm perform better.
  - **Label Encoding:** Encoding the diagnosis (Benign or Malignant) into numeric labels (0 or 1).
  - **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most relevant features to avoid overfitting and improve model accuracy.
  -   Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing subsets for validation.
2. **KNN Model Development:**
  - mplemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), optimizing results with k=3, k=4, k=5 upto k=9
  - Used metrics like Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for thorough evaluation.
3. **Interactive Streamlit Application:**
  - Designed a user-friendly app where users can adjust sliders for tumor features like cell shape, size, and adhesion.
  - Integrated the trained KNN model to predict and display whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
