# Breast Cancer Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
---
## üìã Project Overview:
The Breast Cancer Prediction app is designed to assist in identifying whether a breast tumor is Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous). It uses a machine learning model trained on historical data of tumor features to classify the tumor. This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input tumor details and get predictions instantly.

## üìå K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and effective supervised machine learning technique.
- **How it Works:**
  - KNN classifies a new data point based on its proximity to other data points in the dataset.
  - It calculates the distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the new data point and its nearest neighbors.
  - The majority class among the neighbors determines the classification result.

## üîç Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains real-world data on breast tumors.
  - **Features:** The dataset includes numeric features that describe various characteristics of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies.
  - **Labels:**
           - **Benign (0):** Tumors that are non-cancerous and do not spread to other parts of the body.
           - **Malignant (1):** Cancerous tumors that can invade nearby tissues or spread.

## üîë Key Features:
   - **Clump Thickness:** Uniformity of the cell clumps.
   - **Uniformity of Cell Size:** Variation in cell size.
   - **Uniformity of Cell Shape:** Consistency in cell shape.
   - **Marginal Adhesion:** How well cells stick together.
   - **Single Epithelial Cell Size:** Size of single epithelial cells.
   - **Bare Nuclei:** Count of nuclei without cytoplasm.
   - **Bland Chromatin:** Consistency of chromatin in the nucleus.
   - **Normal Nucleoli:** Size and visibility of nucleoli.
   - **Mitoses:** Frequency of cell division.
